# [Binary Search Tree](BinarySearchTree.js)

A Tree data strucutre, in which every parent has at most two children. Every node to the left of a parent node is always less than that parent. Ever node to the right of a parent node is always greater than that parent. This organization makes searching a Binary Search Tree extremely fast.

| Operation | Time complexity | Array Time |
| :-------- | :-------------- | :--------- |
| Insertion | **O(log n)**    | O(n)       |
| Searching | **O(log n)**    | O(n)       |
