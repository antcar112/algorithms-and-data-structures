# [Binary Heaps](MaxBinaryHeap.js)

Heaps are another type of Tree data structure. Binary Heaps are a type of Binary Tree, with each parent having at most two child nodes. Binary heaps are as compact as possible, meaning that all children of each node are as full as possible, with the left child being filled out first.

In a Max Binary Heap, parent nodes are always larger than child nodes. In a Min Binary Heap, parents are smaller than child nodes.

Binary Heaps a great data structure for sorting. They excel at inserting and removing data in an set order.

| Operation | Time complexity | Array Time |
| :-------- | :-------------- | :--------- |
| Insertion | **O(log n)**    | O(n)       |
| Removal   | **O(log n)**    | O(n)       |
| Searching | O(n)            | O(n)       |
