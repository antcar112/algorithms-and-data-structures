# [Stack](Stack.js)

A data structure that follows a LIFO (last in, first out) principle. This means that the last element added to a stack will be the first element removed.

| Operation | Time complexity | Array Time |
| :-------- | :-------------- | :--------- |
| Insertion | **O(1)**        | O(n)       |
| Removal   | **O(1)**        | O(n)       |
| Searching | O(n)            | O(n)       |
| Access    | O(n)            | **O(1)**   |

**Note:** Searching & accessing don't matter for Stacks, since we're only ever getting the most recent element. If you do care about searching or accessing specific indexes, better data structures exist
