# [Queue](Queue.js)

Similar to a Stack, but follows a FIFO (first in, first out) principle. This means that the first element added will be also the first element removed.

| Operation | Time complexity | Array Time |
| :-------- | :-------------- | :--------- |
| Insertion | **O(1)**        | O(n)       |
| Removal   | **O(1)**        | O(n)       |
| Searching | O(n)            | O(n)       |
| Access    | O(n)            | **O(1)**   |

**Note:** Again, as searching & accessing aren't used by Stacks, they don't actually matter.
